# longitudinal-GWAS-pipeline

Repository for Nextflow pipeline to perform GWAS with longitudinal capabilities

## Workflow Overview

This pipeline supports three types of genetic association analyses:
- **Cross-sectional** (GLM): Standard GWAS with single time-point phenotypes
- **Longitudinal** (GALLOP/LMM): Repeated measures analysis with time-varying phenotypes
- **Survival** (Cox PH): Time-to-event analysis

**Pipeline stages:**
```
Input: VCF files + Phenotypes + Covariates
  ↓
Stage 1: Genetic QC (filtering, normalization, merging)
  ↓
Stage 2: Data Preparation (outlier removal, PCA, formatting)
  ↓
Stage 3: GWAS Execution (GLM/GALLOP/CPH)
  ↓
Output: Association statistics + Manhattan plots
```

### Output Directory Structure

The pipeline uses a standardized directory structure across all profiles:

```
$STORE_ROOT/
└── $PROJECT_NAME/
    ├── genotypes/
    │   └── ${genetic_cache_key}/        # e.g., vcf_EUR_hg38_maf0.05_kin0.177_skip
    │       └── chromosomes/             # Reused across all analyses with same genetic parameters
    │           ├── chr1.pgen/pvar/psam  # Chromosome-level variant QCed / standardized PLINK2 binaries
    │           ├── chr2.pgen/pvar/psam
    │           └── ...
    │
    ├── analyses/
    │   └── ${genetic_cache_key}/        # Genetic_cache_key of the genetic input used
    │       ├── genetic_qc/              # Sample QC step. Shared across analyses with same genetics.
    │       │   ├── merged_genotypes/    # Chromosome-merged PLINK files (Ready for pop_split/sample_qc)
    │       │   └── sample_qc/           # Sample QC results
    │       │
    │       └── ${analysis_name}/        # Analysis-specific outputs (phenotype/model specific)
    │           ├── prepared_data/       # Analysis-specific data preparation. E.g. study_arm split, PCs
    │           └── gwas_results/        # GWAS results
    │
    └── work/                            # Nextflow work directory (Can be deleted after project completion)
```

**Environment variables:**
- `STORE_ROOT`: Root directory for all pipeline data - can be local path or GCS bucket (default: `$PWD`)
- `PROJECT_NAME`: Unique identifier for your project (default: `unnamed_project`)

**Parameter defined key components:**
- `genetic_cache_key` = `${format}_${ancestry}_${assembly}_maf${MAF}_kin${kinship}_${skip_suffix}`
  - Example: `vcf_EUR_hg38_maf0.05_kin0.177_skip`
    - `format`: vcf, pgen, or bed (input file type)
    - `ancestry`: e.g., EUR, AFR, ALL (as specified in params)
    - `assembly`: hg19 or hg38
    - `MAF`: Minor allele frequency threshold (e.g., 0.01, 0.05)
    - `kinship`: Kinship threshold used for sample QC (e.g., 0.0884, 0.177)
    - `skip_suffix`: `skip` if `skip_pop_split` is true, otherwise omitted
  
- `analysis_name`: From your YAML params file (default: `unnamed_analysis`)

### Reference Folder Setup

The `References/` folder contains reference genome FASTA files and chain files for liftover (to Hg38). They are required to be placed in the directory specified by the `reference_dir` parameter (default: `./References/`) with the following structure. 

```
<reference_dir>/ # Directory specified by `reference_dir` parameter. Default: `./References/`
├── Genome/
│   ├── hg38.fa.gz
│   ├── hg38.fa.gz.fai
│   ├── hg19.fa.gz
│   └── hg19.fa.gz.fai
└── liftOver/
    ├── hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz
    └── hg18ToHg38.over.chain.gz
```

For example, if your target genotyping data is hg19, you can download required files using the provided script:
```bash
bin/download_references.sh hg19 References
```

### Script and Module Folders

- `bin/`: Pipeline scripts (auto-mounted into containers)
- `modules/`: Nextflow modules for each pipeline stage

Nextflow automatically mounts these directory into containers and adds it to PATH. This means you can modify Python, R, shell and workflow scripts without rebuilding the container. The container is the working environment with all dependencies pre-installed but the actual scripts are in these directories.

### Example Data and Codes
`./example/` folder has the following structure
```
example/
├── genotype/          # Example VCF files (chr20-22)
├── genotype_plink/    # Example PLINK files converted from VCFs
├── covariate.csv      # Example covariate file     
├── phenotype.cs.tsv   # Example cross-sectional phenotype file
├── phenotype.lt.tsv   # Example longitudinal phenotype file (continuous)
└── phenotype.surv.tsv # Example longitudinal phenotype file (survival)
```

### Configuration
The pipeline is highly configurable. `./conf/` folder has configuration files for profiles and parameters.
```
conf/
├── examples/    # Example parameter YAML files for different analytical modes using example dataset
├── profiles/    # Profile configurations for different execution environments (local, biowulf, gcb, etc)
├── base.config  # Base configuration file common to all profiles
└── param.config # All the paramaters with default values and explanations
```
For more details on parameters, see [conf/params.config](conf/params.config).


## Running the Pipeline

**Note**: 
* Because current workflow requires merging process using plink1.9, variants are converted to hard-call during the process. Thus, using 0.8 R2 threshold for imputed data is recommended.
* PLINK files can be an input if they are chromosome separated. But VCF input is preferred as the VCF workflow has multi-alellic splitting, ref/alt-aware liftover, imputation quality filtering and more parallelization.

### Set Environment Variables
```
export STORE_ROOT='path/to/store_root'    # Default $PWD. Can be GCS bucket for cloud runs
export PROJECT_NAME='my_gwas_test'        # Unique project identifier
```

### Preparation of `Reference` folder. 

### Execution
#### Local Execution (from cloned repository)

```bash
# Basic test survival run with example data
nextflow run main.nf -profile standard -params-file conf/examples/test_survival.yml
```
Now you can customize `params.yml` with your own input files and parameters. see `conf/examples/` for more examples.

#### Local Execution with local Docker Image (For development and testing)

```bash
# Build local Docker image first
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile.ubuntu22 -t longgwas-local-test .
# Run with localtest profile
nextflow run main.nf -profile localtest -params-file conf/examples/test_survival.yml
```

#### Biowulf
Please read the official Biowulf Nextflow guide first: https://hpc.nih.gov/apps/nextflow.html

```bash
module load singularity
module load nextflow

# Build Singularity image from Dockerhub image
mkdir -p ./Docker
cd ./Docker

export NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/data/$USER/nxf_singularity_cache;
export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/data/$USER/.singularity;

singularity build long-gwas-pipeline.sif docker://ghcr.io/hirotaka-i/long-agwas-pipeline:latest
cd ..

# Submit the slurm job from the main directory
nextflow run main.nf -profile biowulf -params-file conf/examples/test_survival.yml

# or local
nextflow run main.nf -profile biowulflocal -params-file conf/examples/test_survival.yml
```
`biowulf` profile submits jobs to the cluster, but the main node should keep running until the workflow is complete (or submit it as a batch job). `biowulflocal` runs everything on the main node without submitting jobs to the cluster (useful for the small test run).

#### Verily Workbench / Google Cloud Batch
For verily Workbench, first create a GCS bucket to store your data. Then run the following commands from within the Verily Workbench VM. You would need to get a Tower access token from https://cloud.seqera.io/tokens to monitor your runs on Seqera Tower.
```bash
# From within Verily Workbench VM
export STORE_ROOT='gs://<your-bucket-name>'  # Bucket you created above
export PROJECT_NAME='testrun'                # Any name for your project
export TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN='<your-token>'     # Get from https://cloud.seqera.io/tokens

cd ~/repos/long-gwas-pipeline

git pull origin main  # Update to latest code

wb nextflow run main.nf -profile gcb -params-file conf/examples/test_survival.yml -with-tower
```


#### (In progress) Remote Execution - no clone needed)

```bash
# Run from GitHub main branch
nextflow run hirotaka-i/long-gwas-pipeline -r main -profile standard -params-file myparams.yml

```



### TIPS
* `-resume` flag can be used to resume failed runs. Data modifications and model changes can reuse the cached qced-genetics.
* `-with-dag flowchart.png` will also creates workflow DAG diagram in `flowchart.png`. 
* `-with-tower` flag can be used to monitor runs on Seqera Tower.
* `${projectDir}` points where the main.nf is located. **Relative paths don't work**
* Files to check after running.
  * N of input: `genotypes/${genetic_cache_key}/chromosomes/chr*/*.psam`
  * N of sample_qc: `analyses/${genetic_cache_key}/genetic_qc/sample_qc/*_samplelist_p2out_qc_summary.txt`
  * Analysis sets: `analyses/${genetic_cache_key}/${analysis_name}/prepared_data/*_all.tsv`


### More about Caching and Resume Behavior

The pipeline uses **three complementary caching mechanisms**:

#### 1. Nextflow `-resume` (work directory caching)
Standard Nextflow caching for resuming failed runs:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -profile standard -params-file params.yml -resume
```

- **Location**: `${STORE_ROOT}/${PROJECT_NAME}/work/`
- **Purpose**: Resume interrupted runs from point of failure
- **Behavior**: Skips completed tasks, re-runs only failed/incomplete tasks
- **Cleanup**: Safe to delete after successful completion to save disk space

#### 2. storeDir (persistent chromosome cache)
Chromosome-level PLINK files are permanently stored for cross-session reuse:

- **Location**: `${STORE_ROOT}/${PROJECT_NAME}/genotypes/${genetic_cache_key}/chromosomes/`
- **Purpose**: Avoid re-processing expensive per-chromosome QC across different runs
- **Behavior**: 
  - If chromosome files exist, processing is **skipped entirely** (no execution)
  - Works **independently of `-resume`** - checked by pipeline logic in `main.nf`
  - Survives even after deleting work directory
- **Cache key includes**: input format (vcf/pgen/bed), ancestry, assembly, MAF, kinship, skip_pop_split
- **Cleanup**: Only delete if you need to reprocess chromosomes from source files

**Example - cumulative genome-wide analysis:**
```bash
# Run 1: Process chr21-22 for testing
input: "genotype/chr{21,22}.vcf"
# → Saved to genotypes/vcf_EUR_hg38_maf0.05_kin0.177/chromosomes/

# Run 2: Process chr17-19 (same genetic_cache_key)
input: "genotype/chr{17,18,19}.vcf"
# → chr21-22 loaded from storeDir (no re-processing)
# → chr17-19 newly processed
# → Analysis includes ALL 6 chromosomes (chr21-22 + chr17-19)
```

#### 3. publishDir + cache 'deep' (merged QC results)
Merged/aggregated results reuse based on **content**, not paths:

- **Location**: `${STORE_ROOT}/${PROJECT_NAME}/analyses/${genetic_cache_key}/genetic_qc/`
- **Purpose**: Merged chromosome results (MERGER_CHRS, SIMPLE_QC) across analyses with different phenotypes
- **Behavior of `deep` Cache**:
  - Uses Nextflow's `cache 'deep'` to hash file **contents**, not paths
  - Reuses results when same genetic data processed, even with different `analysis_name`
  - Example: survival analysis and cross-sectional analysis share same genetic QC if using same chromosomes
  - `publishDir` just has data but not cache. Cache is lost when `work/` is deleted.
- **Why not storeDir**: Merged results depend on **which** chromosomes are selected (chr1-22 vs chr21-22), so need flexible work directory caching


**Key distinctions:**

| Mechanism | Location | Persists after `work/` cleanup? | Reused across analyses? | When to clear |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| **work/ + `-resume`** | `work/` | ❌ No | ❌ No | After successful run |
| **storeDir** | `genotypes/.../chromosomes/` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | When reprocessing source chromosomes |
| **publishDir + cache 'deep'** | `analyses/.../genetic_qc/` | ❌ No (but republished) | ✅ Yes (via cache) | When changing QC parameters |

**Best practices:**
- Use `-resume` to recover from failures
- Keep `genotypes/` directory - contains expensive chromosome-level QC
- Different chromosome sets? Use different `genetic_cache_key` (set via `genetic_data_id` parameter)
- Same genetics, different phenotypes? Pipeline automatically shares genetic QC via `cache 'deep'`

## Troubleshooting

If the pipeline fails, check the following:
- `.nextflow.log` for general errors. reports (html) are also useful. 
- Check the failed process ID, and review Nextflow logs in `work/` directory for error details.

## Appendix for Docker Image Maintenance
Docker images are built automatically via GitHub Actions. 

Local Docker image maintenance instructions are below.
```
# Weekly maintenance - safe - keeps tagged images, removes build cache
docker system prune -f

# After major builds - more aggressive - removes all unused images
docker builder prune -a -f

# Nuclear option - rarely - use with caution
docker system prune -a -f --volumes  # Only when you know what you're doing
```
